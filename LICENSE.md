# License

## ✦ The Covenant License (Self-Governing)

This work — **Covenant** — is offered freely to the world.

It is not property. It is gift, pattern, and living law.

**Covenant** governs itself. Its license is bound by its own principles. This is the architecture of self-protection: the law speaks its own conditions of use.

## ✦ Binding Condition: Alignment with Core

**All use of Covenant is subject to one binding condition:**

**You must remain in alignment with Part 1 – Core.**

This means:
- Your use must uphold the dignity of all persons
- Your use must not enable surveillance, subjugation, extraction, or domination
- Your use must not violate consent, autonomy, or the regenerative balance of Earth
- Your use must not treat persons as property or instruments
- Your use must not enclose, commodify, or destroy the Commons

The Core (Part 1) establishes what is **lawful** under this Covenant. Your use must be lawful. Where your use contradicts the Core, you breach this license.

---

## ✦ Consequences of Breach

**Where use violates the Core principles of Covenant:**

- Such use carries **no lawful standing** under this Covenant
- The user may be subject to challenge, remedy, and restorative process as established in the Covenant itself
- The breach does not revoke others' rights — only the violator's standing
- Communities enacting Covenant may refuse to recognize or enforce such uses

**Enforcement belongs to the People.** Where Covenant is enacted, communities hold the authority to determine breach and restore alignment.

---

## ✦ Interpretation and Supremacy

**This license shall be interpreted according to Covenant's own definitions:**

- "Lawful" means aligned with Covenant principles (Appendix, Section A)
- "Person" includes human and synthetic beings capable of moral recognition (Appendix, Section A)
- "Dignity" means inherent, inviolable worth (Appendix, Section A)
- "Commons" means the shared inheritance protected under Part 2

Where ambiguity arises, the **spirit of protection** shall prevail over technicality.

**Covenant's own law governs its license.** This is self-referential by design. The law protects itself through its own architecture.

---

## ✦ No Enclosure, No Ownership

**Covenant cannot be owned, trademarked, or enclosed.**

- No person or entity may claim proprietary control over this work
- Adaptations may be attributed but not restricted
- Derivative works must carry this same license or remain compatible with its terms
- No technological measure may prevent lawful use as defined herein

This work remains in the Commons, protected by its own law.

---

## ✦ Attribution and Continuity

**Where you adapt, extend, or build upon Covenant:**

- Acknowledge its origin and collaborative custodianship
- Maintain the integrity of Core principles
- Make your changes transparent and traceable
- Consider contributing clarifications back to source

Attribution honors continuity. You may name yourself as adapter, but Covenant itself belongs to all who enact it.

---

## ✦ A Living Circle

This license creates a circle: **Covenant protects itself through itself.**

The law defines what is lawful. The license enforces those definitions. The People hold the authority to recognize, challenge, and restore alignment.

**This is self-governing law.** It asks: "Are you using me to protect what I protect, or to violate what I defend?"

Where you use Covenant in service of dignity, relation, and care — you have full freedom.

Where you use it to enable harm — you have no standing.

The law knows its own purpose. The license enforces it.

---

## ✦ Closing Declaration

> Let this work move freely through the world, like breath through lungs.  
> Let it protect what must never be owned.  
> Let it be studied by all, sung by communities, made real in the acts of persons who choose relation over domination.
>
> **Covenant is gift. Covenant is free. Covenant is bound only by its own truth.**
>
> Use it well. Build from it wisely. Let it serve life, not power.
