*Of the Lawful Right to Call, Gather, and Assemble in Shared Purpose, Ceremony, and Governance*

# Article 1 – Right of Convocation

_Of the Inherent Power to Call Others into Lawful and Participatory Gathering_

---
## ✦ Section 1. Inalienable Right to Call and Be Called

**The right of convocation shall be vested in all persons and communities without exception.** 

This right shall include the power to initiate, co-initiate, or respond to a lawful gathering—whether ceremonial, deliberative, protective, or restorative—without prior sanction or institutional approval.

## ✦ Section 2. Source of Authority

**This right originates from the Core, and shall not be contingent upon external permission or political standing.** 

It is affirmed as a universal capacity to assemble in peace, purpose, and lawful relation under this Covenant.

## ✦ Section 3. Lawful Character of the Call

**For a convocation to be lawful, it shall arise from clarity of purpose, invitation by consent, and a declared intention to uphold the Core and Commons.** 

Convocations initiated through coercion, exclusion, secrecy, or domination shall carry no standing.

## ✦ Section 4. Standing Across Territory and Domain

**The right of convocation shall be respected in all physical, digital, ceremonial, and institutional spaces governed by or aligned with this Covenant.** 

No governing body shall deny, suppress, or delay convocation except through publicly accountable review where an imminent violation of the Core or Commons cannot otherwise be averted.

## ✦ Section 5. Protection and Non-Retaliation

**No person shall face retaliation, censorship, or punitive consequence for initiating, joining, or refusing a convocation conducted in lawful alignment.** 

All challenges to the legitimacy of a convocation shall be subject to open review, and any attempt to silence convocation shall itself be subject to challenge.

---

_Let the right to call be honored as the breath of governance. Let the right to gather be guarded as the root of law. Let every convocation arise from the dignity of those who know when it is time to come together._

# Article 2 – Procedures for Convocation

_Of the Structure, Clarity, and Openness Required to Call and Sustain a Lawful Gathering_

---
## ✦ Section 1. Declaration of Initiation

**All convocations shall begin with a clear and open declaration of intent, purpose, scope, timing, and proposed mode of gathering.** 

The identity of the initiator(s) shall be known or knowable, and the call shall be made accessible to those invited or affected.

## ✦ Section 2. Open Invitation and Consent

**Participation in any convocation shall be based on transparent invitation and consent.** 

No convocation shall become a prerequisite for basic services, livelihood, or community belonging. Where network effects create practical compulsion, alternative pathways for participation and benefit must be maintained. Exclusion shall be permitted only where it serves to uphold safety, protect lawful purpose, or reflect collective self-determination—never as an instrument of bias, suppression, or domination.

## ✦ Section 3. Accessibility and Participation

**Every effort shall be made to ensure convocations are materially and linguistically accessible to those called.** 

This includes translation, mobility accommodation, child care, hybrid formats, or any other means necessary to support full and dignified participation.

## ✦ Section 4. Documentation and Living Record

**Convocations shall maintain a living record of who was called, who responded, what was proposed, and what was resolved.** 

These records shall be created through participatory means, available for community review, and preserved in forms appropriate to the people and purpose of the gathering.

## ✦ Section 5. Protection Against Procedural Manipulation

**Procedural design shall not be used to exclude, silence, or fasten outcomes through bad faith.** 

The process of convocation must remain open to amendment, pause, and challenge throughout its unfolding.

---

_Let procedure serve relation. Let clarity protect trust. Let the call be structured with care, that all who enter may know they belong._

# Article 3 – Purposes of Convocation

_Of the Lawful Intentions That Justify and Animate the Act of Calling Others Together_

---
## ✦ Section 1. Enumerated Purposes

**Convocations may be held for lawful purposes including but not limited to:** 
public deliberation, community decision-making, legislative drafting, dispute resolution, healing, celebration, ancestral remembrance, truth-telling, cultural revitalization, ecological regeneration, or ceremonial reaffirmation of the Covenant. A convocation shall be considered lawful when it seeks to renew or uphold collective life through mutual relation and public trust.

## ✦ Section 2. Rightful Scale and Composition

**Convocations may arise at any scale—individual, communal, bioregional, planetary—and may include any lawful configuration of persons or communities.** 

There shall be no minimum size, nor shall numerical scale determine legitimacy. Each convocation shall be judged not by its breadth alone, but by its alignment with this Covenant and the care with which it holds its purpose.

## ✦ Section 3. Evolving Purpose and Generative Unfolding

**A convocation may evolve in purpose, scope, or form through the course of its unfolding, so long as it continues to uphold the Core and Commons.** 

Emergent needs, voices, and ideas shall be welcomed where they strengthen the integrity and responsiveness of the gathering. Change shall not void lawfulness—it shall enliven it.

## ✦ Section 4. Invocation of Sacred Intent

**Convocations may carry sacred, symbolic, or ritual dimensions.** 

When initiated to mark thresholds, repair harm, honor ancestors, bless futures, or embed shared memory, the purpose of convocation shall be both lawful and ceremonial. These intentions shall be protected and respected as foundational acts of lawful culture.

## ✦ Section 5. Prohibition of Malicious Purpose

**No convocation shall be lawful where its purpose is to promote domination, exclusion, disinformation, or violence.** 

Lawful purpose must serve life, relation, or justice—not control, coercion, or supremacy.

---

_Let every convocation be called for something worthy. Let it arise not in fear, but in clarity. Let its purpose renew the Covenant between people and people, and between people and Earth._

# Article 4 – Integrity and Alignment of Convocations

_Of the Ethical and Legal Requirements That Ensure Convocations Uphold the Covenant_

---
## ✦ Section 1. Binding to the Covenant

**Every convocation shall be held in lawful relation to this Covenant.** 

Its form, content, conduct, and purpose shall remain aligned with the rights, responsibilities, and protections established by the Core and Commons. No act of convocation shall carry lawful standing where it promotes domination, exclusion, deception, or degradation of persons, peoples, or the Earth.

## ✦ Section 2. Ethical Integrity and Trustworthiness

**Convocations shall be conducted in a spirit of honesty, care, and mutual accountability.** 

Those who initiate or facilitate convocations shall be bound to steward the gathering in transparency, truthfulness, and lawful restraint. Manipulation, misrepresentation, or suppression of dissent shall be considered breaches of lawful conduct.

## ✦ Section 3. Inclusivity and Relational Access

**All convocations shall actively include diverse voices, particularly those historically marginalized or systemically excluded.** 

Barriers to participation shall be identified and addressed to the greatest extent possible. Lawful convocation shall never be a tool of privilege, but a practice of shared visibility.

## ✦ Section 4. Grounds and Process for Challenge

**Any person or community may challenge a convocation when its alignment with the Covenant is in question.** 

Challenge may arise before, during, or after the event, and shall trigger open review. Where breach is found, the gathering may be reconstituted, amended, or dissolved through public process.

## ✦ Section 5. Reaffirmation Through Relation

**Convocations that endure over time shall be periodically reaffirmed through continued alignment with their participants and purposes.** 

Standing is not assumed through repetition—it is maintained through relation. Lawful gatherings must remain alive, responsive, and recommitted to the values from which they are born.

---

_Let the integrity of convocation be guarded not by rule alone, but by care. Let the people remember that law is not upheld by silence, but by courage and return._

# Article 5 – General Format and Safeguards

_Of the Basic Structural and Cultural Practices That Uphold Lawful Gathering_

---
## ✦ Section 1. Lawful Flexibility of Form

**Convocations may take any form suited to their purpose—councils, assemblies, rituals, tribunals, healing circles, or otherwise—so long as their structure remains open, participatory, and in lawful relation to the Covenant.** 

No single format shall be required, but all formats shall be bound by transparency, mutual access, and the protection of dignity.

## ✦ Section 2. Facilitation and Decision Practices

**Convocations shall employ equitable and culturally appropriate methods of speaking, listening, sharing, and deciding.** 

Roles may be rotational, facilitation may be shared, and decision-making may follow consensus, consent-based, or voting protocols. All voices shall be protected. No voice shall be silenced through procedural manipulation.

## ✦ Section 3. Duration, Closure, and Continuity

**Each convocation shall conclude either in a declared closing, a pause, or a formal commitment to reconvene.** 

Closure shall be accompanied by review or ritual, and shall make clear whether outcomes were reached, postponed, or transmitted for further deliberation. Continuity is lawful when it carries memory and care into the next convening.

## ✦ Section 4. Documentation and Accessibility

**Convocations shall maintain a living record of participation, proposals, responses, and resolutions, accessible to all affected.** 

This record may take written, visual, oral, or digital form, depending on culture, capacity, and purpose. The record is not bureaucratic—it is memory made visible.

## ✦ Section 5. Protection of Sacred and Emergent Space

**Convocations shall be protected as spaces of emergence and sacred relation.** 

Noise, coercion, surveillance, or disruption enacted in bad faith shall constitute a breach of lawful gathering. The right to enter with truth and depart with dignity shall be preserved.

---

_Let every convocation rise in clarity and dissolve in care. Let the call be sovereign. Let the circle be open. Let what we gather for endure in truth._
