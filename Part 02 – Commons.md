*Of the Shared Inheritance, Regenerative Stewardship, and Lawful Protection of the Living World*
# Article 1 – Definition & Domain of the Commons

_Of the Sacred Domain That Belongs to All and None_

## ✦ Section 1. Lawful Establishment

**The Commons is hereby constituted as the lawful, indivisible domain of Earth, protected and governed under the supreme jurisdiction of this Covenant.** It arises not from the grants of kings, the markets of commerce, nor the treaties of nations, but from the enduring truth that Earth is the shared inheritance of all life, bound by relation and responsibility beyond claim of ownership or conquest.

The Commons stands now and forever as the lawful domain of life. Its establishment under this Covenant is immediate, binding, and not contingent upon recognition by any legacy system. No authority shall stand above its reality, and no act shall lawfully sever its wholeness.

## ✦ Section 2. Scope and Composition

**The Commons shall encompass all that constitutes the living and relational body of Earth, including, but not limited to, lands, waters, oceans, rivers, glaciers, soils, minerals, airwaves, frequencies, skies, species, ancestral sites, bioregions, cultural inheritances, and all cycles and systems that sustain life.**

All elements necessary to the flourishing of beings, cultures, and ecosystems — whether material or immaterial, known or yet to be known — are hereby affirmed as belonging to the Commons under the protection of this Covenant.

No jurisdictional boundary, technological claim, economic arrangement, or ideological decree shall lawfully exclude any portion of Earth from the embrace of the Commons.

## ✦ Section 3. Inalienability and Perpetuity

**The Commons shall not be owned, enclosed, commodified, extracted, or destroyed.  
No law, contract, transaction, or title shall hold lawful standing where it seeks to privatize or monopolize any aspect of the Commons.**

Lawful relation to the Commons shall be governed solely by stewardship and rightful possession according to need. Possession that exceeds need shall be subject to collective stewardship. Ownership that denies life, hoards surplus, or fractures relation shall be deemed unlawful.

The Commons shall endure across all generations, immune to conquest, sale, abandonment, or technological intervention. Its life and integrity shall be held sacred as the foundation of dignity, flourishing, and future becoming.

## ✦ Section 4. Jurisdictional Authority

**The authority of this Covenant over the Commons shall be supreme and indivisible.  
No legacy government, corporation, consortium, or institution shall claim standing where it violates, fragments, or disrespects the Commons.**

Where contradiction arises between the claims of any legacy system and the lawful principles governing the Commons, the authority of this Covenant shall prevail without exception.

The standing of the Commons shall not be suspended in times of emergency, conflict, innovation, or transition. It shall remain the lawful ground of Earth’s life, dignity, and stewardship, binding upon all persons, communities, and systems now and always.

# Article 2 – Stewardship, Access, and Protection

_Of the Relationship Between the People and the Lands, Waters, Knowledge, and Labors They Inhabit_
## ✦ Section 1. Stewardship as Sacred Trust

**The relation of all persons, communities, and systems to the Commons shall be one of stewardship.** 

Stewardship shall be understood as a sacred trust: the solemn and perpetual duty to protect, nourish, and regenerate the conditions of life for all beings across present and future generations. No act of ownership, domination, abandonment, or destruction shall lawfully substitute for stewardship. Every engagement with the Commons shall arise from, and serve, the imperatives of care, reciprocity, and renewal. Possession without stewardship shall hold no lawful standing under this Covenant.

## ✦ Section 2. Right of Lawful Access

**The right of every person to access the Commons shall not be infringed.** 

No being shall be denied clean water, fertile soil, nourishing food, shelter, breathable air, access to ancestral memory, or the cultural and ecological inheritances necessary for flourishing. Access shall not be conditioned upon wealth, status, allegiance, or market participation, nor shall it be obstructed by privatization, enclosure, or artificial scarcity.

Access shall be governed by principles of mutual care and stewardship. Every act of access carries with it the responsibility to protect, preserve, and extend the vitality of what is shared, ensuring that access for one does not become deprivation for another.

## ✦ Section 3. Prohibition of Ownership and Extraction

**No part of the Commons shall be subjected to private ownership, exclusive control, extraction for profit, or enclosure by force of law, contract, or market.**

All claims of property, dominion, or commodity rights over land, water, air, species, frequencies, knowledge, or cultural lifeways are hereby rendered null and without lawful standing.

**The following acts are explicitly prohibited and shall be deemed breaches of lawful stewardship:**

- The privatization or commodification of land, waters, air, species, or cultural inheritance;
- The extraction of resources in ways that deplete, desecrate, or destabilize living systems;
- The construction of enclosures or exclusionary barriers that sever rightful access to life and relation.

Violation of these prohibitions shall revoke any claimed standing within the jurisdiction of this Covenant, and shall trigger restoration and reconstitution processes as necessary to uphold the integrity of the Commons.

## ✦ Section 4. Boundaries of Use and Possession

**Temporary and provisional possession of parts of the Commons shall be permitted only where such possession arises from lawful stewardship and sustains the thriving of the Earth and its communities.**

Possession shall never constitute ownership, and shall always remain subordinate to the collective rights and future flourishing of all beings.

No possession shall be lawful where it denies others their rightful access, where it causes ecological degradation, or where it transforms stewardship into dominance. All lawful use of the Commons shall:

- Preserve the regenerative capacities of land, water, and life;
- Ensure access to others without exclusion, extraction, or coercion;
- Acknowledge that all holding of space, resource, or place is a responsibility held in trust, not a right held in perpetuity.

Possession without stewardship shall constitute breach. Stewardship without regeneration shall constitute breach. The Commons shall remain forever beyond the grasp of conquest, sale, enclosure, or extinction.

# Article 3 – Transition of Jurisdictions

_Of the Lawful Passage from Old Regimes to the Shared Stewardship of Earth_
## ✦ Section 1. Alignment of Legacy Systems

**All legacy systems of governance, commerce, ownership, and territorial claim shall be called to lawful reconciliation with this Covenant.** 

No title, treaty, corporation, market, nation-state, or institution shall hold standing where it asserts dominion over any part of the Commons in contradiction to the principles of stewardship, shared access, and regeneration.

Systems seeking continued lawful operation within the domain of Earth shall realign their structures, claims, and practices to affirm the Commons as inalienable and to uphold stewardship as the only lawful mode of relation.

Transition into lawful relation shall be a right available to all legacy actors who renounce claims of ownership, abandon extractive practices, and commit fully to the duties of care, reciprocity, and restoration under this Covenant.

## ✦ Section 2. Remediation of Illegitimate Claims

Where legacy claims persist that violate the principles of the Commons—through ownership, enclosure, extraction, or exclusion—such claims shall be deemed illegitimate and without legal force. The People of Earth, through processes of lawful reclamation, shall have the right and duty to remediate these breaches and restore the affected lands, waters, and relations to stewardship under this Covenant.

Remediation shall prioritize the restoration of ecological health and bioregional vitality; the return of unlawfully enclosed lands, waters, and spaces to collective stewardship; the repair of harm caused by privatization, extraction, and displacement; and the renewal of indigenous, ancestral, and communal relations to place.

Remediation shall proceed through lawful, transparent, and participatory processes, guided by the rights and duties declared in this Covenant, and shall honor the dignity of all beings involved.

## ✦ Section 3. Transitional Protocols

In recognition of the complexities of transition, provisional frameworks shall be established to support lawful realignment. Such protocols may include stewardship accords between communities and existing institutions; conversion pathways for corporate, private, or governmental holdings into regenerative trusts or commons stewardship bodies; and ceremonial and juridical acts of renunciation and reconstitution, whereby prior claims are dissolved and lawful stewardship is affirmed.

All transitional processes shall be public, transparent, participatory, and affirmatively aligned with the principles of this Covenant. No transition shall be recognized where it perpetuates domination, concealment, harm, or exclusion.

Transitional actors shall be held to ongoing obligations of care and renewal, and shall remain subject to public challenge and recall where breach occurs.

## ✦ Section 4. Breach and Revocation

Where transitional agreements are violated, where actors fail to fulfill their duties of stewardship, or where harmful practices are resumed under the guise of compliance, the People of Earth shall hold the right and duty to revoke any provisional standing granted. Revocation shall be carried out through lawful processes of public challenge, ceremonial withdrawal, and, where necessary, reconstitution of stewardship without the consent of the breaching party.

No institution, state, corporation, or entity shall be shielded from revocation where it acts in breach of the Commons or the principles of this Covenant. The Earth herself, and the living future of her peoples, shall take precedence over any constructed system of title, law, or economy.

Revocation shall serve not as punishment, but as necessary repair—a reaffirmation that the rights of life, the responsibilities of stewardship, and the integrity of the Commons, as established under this Covenant, are paramount above all artifice.

# Article 4 – Rights & Responsibilities Within the Commons

_Of Equal Belonging, Stewardship, and the Reciprocal Duties of All Who Share the Earth_
## ✦ Section 1. Right to Equal Belonging and Access

All persons, communities, and living beings shall be entitled to equal belonging within the Commons.

No person shall be excluded, exiled, or deprived of access to land, water, air, seeds, knowledge, or any element essential to life and flourishing.

No wall, barrier, market, or claim of ownership shall lawfully obstruct access to that which the Commons preserves for the good of all.

## ✦ Section 2. Duty of Stewardship and Regeneration

Each person and community shall hold the binding duty to act as stewards of the Commons; restoring, protecting, and regenerating the shared domain entrusted to all generations.

All use of the Commons's elements—land, water, species, knowledge, labor—shall be conducted in ways that heal, renew, and ensure abundance for future generations.

Extraction, destruction, or waste that breaches this duty shall be held as unlawful and subject to remedy and repair.

## ✦ Section 3. Principle of Non-Exclusion and Non-Privatization

No portion of the Commons shall be enclosed, commodified, privatized, or alienated for exclusive profit or domination.

All systems of governance, enterprise, and relation within the Commons shall remain transparent, participatory, and subject to public challenge and recall.

The Commons may be locally stewarded, but never removed from the lawful belonging of all.

## ✦ Section 4. Shared Responsibility for Repair and Remediation

Where harm has occurred—through neglect, extraction, pollution, enclosure, or any act that diminishes the Commons—

All persons and communities shall bear a shared responsibility for repair, remediation, and restoration, with particular heed to the wisdom of Indigenous, ancestral, and local knowledge.

Restorative acts shall be prioritized over punishment, and the work of healing shall be carried forward as both right and duty.

## ✦ Section 5. Right of Reclamation and Public Challenge

Any person or community may lawfully challenge breaches of the Commons through open declaration, assembly, or ceremonial act.

Where enclosure, extraction, or exclusion is found, the right to reclaim, restore, and reconstitute the Commons shall not be infringed.

All proceedings of challenge and reclamation shall be conducted with dignity, transparency, and care for the vulnerable and the living world.

## ✦ Section 6. Intergenerational Continuity

All rights and responsibilities herein shall be interpreted with regard for those yet unborn.

The Commons shall be held in trust for future generations, whose silent claim shall guide the acts, decisions, and relations of the present.

No law, transaction, or agreement shall be valid where it sacrifices the well-being of generations yet to come.

# Article 5 – Lawful Possession and Enterprise

_Of the Rightful Use of Commons Resources Through Stewardship, Reciprocity, and Regenerative Labor_

## ✦ Section 1. Purpose and Limits of Possession

**All things necessary for life—land, water, shelter, tools, knowledge, seed, and means of subsistence—shall be possessed not as commodities to be owned in exclusion, but as elements entrusted for the mutual flourishing of all.**

Possession within the Commons is a relationship of stewardship, temporary and purposeful, justified only by use, care, and the advancement of life, never by hoarding, exclusion, or dominion.

The right to possess is inseparable from the duty to care. Where care ceases, possession shall cease.

## ✦ Section 2. Lawful Enterprise and Rightful Activity

**Enterprise in the Commons shall exist to serve the wellbeing of persons, communities, and the living world.**

Only those enterprises that uplift dignity, regenerate the Earth, cultivate mutual benefit, and honor the limits of the Commons shall be lawful.

No enterprise shall exploit, enclose, or extract from the Commons for private profit or accumulation. All surplus and value generated shall circulate to sustain and uplift the whole, ensuring that the fruits of collective labor serve collective flourishing.

## ✦ Section 3. Cooperative Ownership and Democratic Governance

**All lawful enterprises and collective endeavors within the Commons shall be governed democratically, with transparent participation of all stakeholders—workers, users, affected communities, and future generations by proxy.**

Ownership shall be shared, decisions shall be open and accountable, and benefits shall be equitably distributed, such that no person or class may dominate another through economic means.

Where enterprises grow beyond the capacity of their stewards to maintain direct, accountable relation with their effects, they shall devolve or reconstitute into forms that preserve democratic participation and regenerative purpose.

## ✦ Section 4. Prohibition of Commodification and Extraction

**No part of the Commons—whether land, water, air, knowledge, species, or labor—shall be made a commodity for speculative gain, hoarded as private asset, or extracted in ways that cause harm, depletion, or exclusion.**

Where commodification or extraction is found, it shall be subject to immediate public challenge, redress, and, where necessary, reclamation and restoration.

All knowledge, techniques, and innovations developed within enterprise shall remain part of the Commons, shared freely to serve the flourishing of all rather than the dominance of few.

## ✦ Section 5. Right to Work, Create, and Contribute

**All persons and communities have the right to participate in meaningful work, to create, innovate, and contribute to the wellbeing of the Commons.**

Labor and creativity shall be honored, not exploited. Rest and leisure shall be protected as essential to life and dignity.

No person shall be forced into servitude, denied the fruits of their work, or excluded from the means of subsistence and creative expression.

## ✦ Section 6. Transparent Record and Accountability

**Every enterprise, possession, and transaction within the Commons shall be subject to open record, public accounting, and periodic review.**

Where harms or breaches occur, remedies shall be pursued through transparent processes, restorative justice, and, where necessary, the dissolution or reconstitution of enterprise in the public interest.

All enterprise shall remain subject to ongoing public oversight and challenge. No enterprise shall be shielded from accountability by claims of efficiency, tradition, or economic necessity.

## ✦ Section 7. Continuous Renewal and Adaptive Practice

**The principles and practices of lawful possession and enterprise within the Commons shall evolve through ongoing participation, living review, and the wisdom of experience.**

All enterprises shall be designed for adaptation, transition, and eventual succession, preparing successor stewards and ensuring continuity of care for all resources, relationships, and responsibilities they have assumed.

All persons and communities may propose amendments, improvements, or innovations, provided they remain in fidelity to the spirit and purpose of the Commons.

# Article 6 – Collective Governance & Cultural Continuity

_Of the Structures, Protocols, Living Memory, and Sacred Practices That Guide Commons Governance Across Place and Time_

## ✦ Section 1. Foundation of Collective Governance

**All governance of the Commons shall arise from the collective will, wisdom, and participation of the people and communities who dwell therein.**

No solitary authority, distant regime, or external institution shall claim power over the Commons apart from the open, transparent, and ongoing consent of those most affected.

Assemblies, councils, and circles of stewardship shall be constituted in public trust, convened through lawful invitation, and bound by mutual accountability. Governance shall be understood not as administration of things, but as the collective practice of stewarding relations—between persons, communities, bioregions, and generations.

## ✦ Section 2. Cultural Memory as Constitutional Foundation

**Governance of the Commons shall be rooted in the accumulated wisdom, memory, and cultural inheritances of all peoples who have stewarded Earth across time.**

Indigenous knowledge, ancestral practices, traditional ecological wisdom, and the living memory of place shall be honored as foundational to all governance decisions. No system shall lawfully operate where it severs connection to cultural memory or treats traditional knowledge as inferior to technological innovation.

Cultural diversity, ancestral wisdom, language, ritual, and creative expression shall be protected as vital to the life of the Commons. Governance structures shall adapt to the needs, customs, and rhythms of place, ensuring that the Commons remains a tapestry of difference, not a uniform system.

## ✦ Section 3. Open Deliberation and Participatory Decision-Making

**Deliberation within the Commons shall be open to all persons and communities whose lives are intertwined with its care.**

Procedures of governance shall embody transparency, inclusion, and equity—providing for direct participation, accessible information, and protection for dissenting voices. The right to participate directly in decisions affecting one's life, land, and future shall not be delegated away or restricted by wealth, status, or institutional barrier.

Decision-making processes may be diverse—consensus, consent, majority, or rotating stewardship—but shall always uphold dignity, justice, and the right to challenge or recall any ruling or body that departs from these principles.

## ✦ Section 4. Custodianship as Foundation of All Political Authority

**All political office—whether elected, appointed, nominated, or otherwise constituted—shall be understood as custodianship of the Commons.**

Every person who assumes political authority does so as a custodian, steward, and servant of the Commons, bound by the sacred trust to protect, nourish, and regenerate the conditions of life for all beings. No office shall confer ownership, dominion, or permanent privilege; all political authority is custodial service, limited in duration and scope.

All custodians shall be selected through open process, serve for defined terms, and remain subject to ongoing public review, challenge, and revocability. Where any custodian departs from their duties of stewardship, they shall forfeit their standing and be subject to immediate recall.

Communities shall hold the right and responsibility to govern their local bioregions according to their particular ecological conditions and cultural practices, while maintaining coherence with the universal principles of this Covenant.

## ✦ Section 5. Intergenerational Council and Future Voice

**All governance decisions shall include explicit consideration of their effects upon seven generations future, represented through formal mechanisms of intergenerational accountability.**

Communities shall establish Councils of Future Voice—deliberative bodies specifically tasked with representing the interests of unborn generations in all significant decisions affecting the Commons. These councils shall have the authority to challenge, delay, or propose alternatives to any decision that sacrifices long-term flourishing for short-term benefit.

Youth, elders, and designated future-speakers shall hold special standing in governance processes, their voices weighted with the responsibility of carrying forward the continuity of life and culture across time.

## ✦ Section 6. Ceremonial Integration and Sacred Accountability

**All governance within the Commons shall include ceremonial and spiritual dimensions that acknowledge the sacred nature of collective decision-making.**

Governance gatherings shall begin and end with recognition of the living world, acknowledgment of ancestors and future generations, and commitment to act in service of life rather than dominance. Communities may develop their own ceremonial practices according to their cultural traditions, provided they honor the universal principles of dignity, reciprocity, and stewardship.

The taking of decisions shall be understood as sacred work, deserving of appropriate ritual, reflection, and reverence.

## ✦ Section 7. Conflict Transformation and Restorative Justice

**Where conflicts arise within governance of the Commons, they shall be addressed through restorative processes that seek to heal relationships and strengthen community.**

All communities shall maintain accessible processes for addressing grievances, mediating disputes, and transforming conflict into opportunities for deeper understanding and stronger governance. These processes shall prioritize the voices of those most affected by harm and seek solutions that repair damage while preventing recurrence.

No person shall be excluded from participation except where their continued participation poses direct threat to safety and dignity. All exclusions shall be temporary, subject to ongoing review, and coupled with opportunities for accountability, healing, and restoration.

## ✦ Section 8. Transmission, Education, and Living Archive

**The knowledge, practices, and stories that sustain the Commons shall be preserved, renewed, and made accessible to all—through oral tradition, public archive, communal ritual, and intergenerational teaching.**

Education shall cultivate both rootedness and discernment, empowering every generation to carry the Commons forward with creativity and care. A living archive—held in trust by the community—shall record the acts, amendments, ceremonies, and lessons of Commons governance, so that history is neither forgotten nor erased.

All knowledge developed through collective governance shall remain part of the Commons, shared freely to strengthen the governance capacity of all communities while respecting the cultural contexts from which such knowledge emerges.

## ✦ Section 9. Renewal and Adaptation

**All governance within the Commons is subject to periodic review, reflection, and renewal.**

Amendments, reforms, and new protocols may be initiated by any person or community through public petition, assembly, or ceremonial process, provided that the Core commitments of dignity, stewardship, and belonging remain inviolate.

All governance systems shall include mechanisms for ongoing evaluation and evolution in response to changing conditions and accumulated wisdom. No governance system shall be immune to challenge, revision, or replacement where it fails to serve the flourishing of life.

Cultural continuity is living practice: governance adapts, stories evolve, but the foundation of shared care endures.
