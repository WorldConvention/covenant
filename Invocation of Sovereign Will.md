_A Declaration of Free Peoples, Interwoven Earth, and the Sacred Right to Govern Ourselves_

⸻

When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for the People of Earth to dissolve the political, legal, and economic bonds which have bound them to systems of domination, and to assume the equal and rightful station to which their dignity entitles them, a decent respect for life, history, and future generations compels us to declare the causes of this severance and the foundation of what follows.

**We hold these truths to be self-evident—not by decree of heaven, nor by legacy of empire, but by the light of our own awareness:**

- That all persons are born free and equal in dignity;
- That they possess by birth the inalienable rights to life, liberation, expression, and care;
- That the Earth is not property to be owned, but a living home to be shared in lawful relation;
- That just governance arises only from the informed, ongoing consent of the governed;
- That wherever any state, system, contract, market, or ideology becomes destructive of these truths, it is not only the right of the people—but their sacred duty—to refuse it, withdraw from it, and constitute new systems of shared life and lawful stewardship.

**We now name, for the record of all peoples and generations, the structures from which we withdraw:**

- From governments that silence dissent, conceal harm, and operate through secrecy and surveillance;
- From systems of extraction that reduce the living Earth to dead capital and deny future generations the right to inherit a world;
- From markets that treat food, water, medicine, and shelter as commodities rather than rights;
- From ideologies that weaponize identity, erase culture, or divide the family for profit or power;
- From states that rule by conquest, maintain borders by force, and criminalize those who flee the conditions they have caused;
- From hierarchies that render some disposable and others untouchable, whether by blood, wealth, race, gender, or creed;
- From platforms and technologies that extract attention, violate privacy, distort truth, and sell behavior to the highest bidder;
- From systems of law that defend property before persons, and punish the poor before they protect the vulnerable;
- From economies built on debt, enclosure, and the permanent displacement of life.

These structures have had every opportunity to evolve. They have refused. They have been petitioned, protested, studied, and reformed. They have resisted. They have been warned, and they have deepened their harm.

They are no longer legitimate in the eyes of the People of Earth.

The Earth—composed of lands, waters, skies, species, cultures, and ancestral memory—is not the domain of governments, but the Commons: the indivisible domain of all life, from which no person shall be exiled and to which no system shall lay final claim. The Commons may be stewarded, protected, inhabited, and shared. But it shall not be enclosed, extracted, commodified, or destroyed.

We rise not in conquest or isolation, but in remembrance and repair.
We rise because the old regimes have failed to protect life.
Because sovereignty cannot be outsourced.
Because no government that survives by domination may stand above the law.

Therefore, in full possession of our inherent authority,
And in witness to the harm that continues in its absence,
We, the People of Earth, do now invoke our Sovereign Will,
And hereby constitute United Earth as the standing government of the Commons—
Not to dominate the world, but to protect it.
Not to erase diversity, but to uphold shared law.
Not to silence the past, but to carry it forward, restored and renewed.

We reject the legitimacy of all systems named above.
We revoke all assumed authorities that violate the truths herein declared.
And we enter now, freely and together, into Covenant.
Let this Invocation stand as a lawful act of reconstitution.
Let it be enacted wherever harm persists and dignity is denied.
Let it be remembered by all who walk forward into justice.

We have chosen. We are sovereign.
We bind ourselves to the law we have made—and to the world we shall protect.
