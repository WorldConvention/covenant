# Article 1 - Foundation and Standing of Enterprise in the Commons

_Of the Lawful Formation of Collective Enterprises in Service to the Commons and the Covenant_

---
## ✦ Section 1. Definition and Purpose

**A Consortium shall be defined as any lawful collective of persons, communities, or entities who enter into durable association for the purpose of shared work, mutual care, regenerative enterprise, or cultural stewardship, in full fidelity to this Covenant.** 

Such bodies may arise to steward resources and labor in common, circulate goods and services, protect cultural or ecological practices, or offer healing, nourishment, and education. Each Consortium shall exist in service to life, not to profit alone, and shall be governed by mutual responsibility, public accountability, and lawful relation to the Commons.

## ✦ Section 2. Lawful Constitution

**A Consortium shall be lawfully constituted when formed through a transparent and participatory process that affirms the Core and Commons as binding law, and which declares a Charter of Purpose detailing its stewardship, governance, and collective commitments.** 

All consortia shall ensure shared ownership of collective tools, resources, and value, and shall uphold open channels for review, challenge, and accountability. No consortium shall be recognized where it replicates domination, exclusion, or extractive practice.

## ✦ Section 3. Rights and Standing

**Every lawfully constituted Consortium shall possess the standing to operate across jurisdictions, to enter into lawful agreement with other communities and entities, to steward resources in trust, and to innovate or distribute in alignment with regenerative law.** 

Such standing is maintained only through continuous fidelity to this Covenant. Where breach occurs, the Consortium's legal standing shall be subject to public challenge, investigation, and revocation.

## ✦ Section 4. Prohibitions and Safeguards

**No Consortium shall lawfully enclose or commodify the Commons, exploit labor or knowledge for private gain, conceal harm, evade review, or concentrate authority beyond recall.** 

All Consortia shall maintain equitable and participatory governance, ensure public transparency, circulate surplus for shared wellbeing, and protect the rights and dignity of all members and affected communities. Authority within a Consortium shall always remain revocable, its actions subject to law, and its purpose grounded in care.

## ✦ Section 5. Dissolution and Reconstitution

**A Consortium may be dissolved through internal agreement, formal withdrawal from its duties, or lawful challenge arising from breach.** 

Upon dissolution, all shared assets and responsibilities shall revert to the stewardship of the People or be transferred to a body lawfully aligned with this Covenant. In cases of harm or systemic failure, a Consortium may be reconstituted only through transparent public process, full acknowledgment of breach, and renewed commitments to law and collective care.

---

_Let every Consortium be a vessel of shared purpose, constituted by care, and held in trust by those it serves._

# Article 2 - Principles of Regenerative Commerce and Mutual Benefit

_Of the Economic Ethic that Governs Trade, Exchange, and Value Creation Under the Covenant_

---

## ✦ Section 1. Regenerative Foundation

**Commerce within the jurisdiction of this Covenant shall be regenerative, participatory, and life-affirming.** It shall serve the health of the Commons, the dignity of labor, the well-being of communities, and the continuity of Earth’s living systems. The purpose of trade is not to accumulate private wealth, but to circulate value in ways that nourish reciprocal stewardship and shared abundance.

## ✦ Section 2. Mutual Benefit and Just Exchange

**All economic relations shall be based on mutual benefit and just exchange.** Fair compensation, consent-based agreements, and transparency in value flows shall be required in every Consortium. The exploitation of asymmetry—whether of knowledge, access, labor, or dependency—shall constitute a breach of lawful commerce. Where trade occurs, it shall uplift all parties and contribute to communal resilience.

## ✦ Section 3. Surplus and Circulation

**Surplus generated by a Consortium shall be reinvested in the Commons or equitably distributed among its contributors and affected communities.** Wealth that is hoarded, hidden, or extracted without restoration shall be regarded as unlawful. Every Consortium shall maintain protocols for ethical reinvestment, mutual aid, and contribution to inter-consortium solidarity.

## ✦ Section 4. Limits on Commodification

**No element of the Commons—land, water, knowledge, genetic material, culture, or care—shall be lawfully commodified or privatized.** Commerce shall operate within the bounds of stewardship, never reducing shared life into saleable asset. Where exchange involves common goods, it shall be bound by consent, reciprocity, and regenerative return.

## ✦ Section 5. Transparency and Public Trust

**Consortia shall conduct their economic affairs with full transparency and public accountability.** Records of income, expenditures, partnerships, and resource flows shall be maintained in forms accessible to members and affected communities. Concealment of profit, unjust enrichment, or deceptive practices shall nullify a Consortium’s standing before this Covenant.

---

*Let commerce be in service to life. Let value arise from care, not control. Let the economy be an act of justice, not domination.*

# Article 3 - Rights and Responsibilities of Workers, Members, and Stakeholders

_Of the Persons Who Animate, Sustain, and Are Affected by Consortia_

---
## ✦ Section 1. Recognition and Standing

**All persons who contribute to, labor within, or are substantively affected by a Consortium shall be regarded as stakeholders with rights and responsibilities under this Covenant.** 

This includes but is not limited to workers, contributors, stewards, affected communities, and users of services or systems maintained by the Consortium. Their participation shall be treated as lawful relation, not expendable function.

## ✦ Section 2. Right to Dignified Labor and Participation

**All workers and contributors within a Consortium shall have the right to meaningful work, fair compensation, safe conditions, reasonable hours, and protected time for rest and regeneration.** 

No one shall be coerced, surveilled, or subjected to exploitation in any form. Participation in governance, decision-making, and public accountability shall be open to all members without discrimination or hierarchy.

## ✦ Section 3. Right to Grievance and Public Challenge

**Any worker, member, or affected party shall have the right to raise concerns, file grievances, and initiate public challenge without fear of retaliation.** 

Clear mechanisms for collective review, restorative response, and structural correction shall be embedded into every Consortium’s governance.

## ✦ Section 4. Duty to Steward and Uphold the Commons

**All members of a Consortium share the responsibility to uphold the Commons, honor the Covenant, and conduct their roles in alignment with principles of justice, care, and transparency.** 

No member shall act in service of personal gain at the expense of collective wellbeing, nor violate the regenerative ethic that governs lawful enterprise.

## ✦ Section 5. Communal Recognition and Renewal

**The community surrounding or served by a Consortium shall retain the standing to review its impact, call for renewal, or propose reconstitution.** 

All governance shall remain transparent to and in lawful dialogue with the communities it touches. Power shall remain accessible, and accountability shall be continuous.

---

*Let no Consortium forget the people who sustain it. Let labor be honored, voices heard, and power held with care.*

# Article 4 - Collective Ownership, Governance, and Stewardship

_Of the Structures That Sustain Shared Power and Lawful Operation in Consortia_

---
## ✦ Section 1. Collective Ownership

**All property, tools, knowledge, and value produced by or essential to a Consortium’s functioning shall be held in collective ownership or lawful stewardship.** 

Ownership shall not reside in individuals or private stakeholders, but in the collective body of members and the communities they serve. Legal structures shall reflect this shared custodianship, with no party holding irrevocable or disproportionate control.

## ✦ Section 2. Participatory Governance

**Each Consortium shall govern itself through participatory structures that ensure voice, transparency, and lawful power for all members.** 

Decision-making bodies shall be composed through open, inclusive processes. Roles shall be rotational, recallable, and bound by fiduciary duty to the whole. Governance mechanisms shall allow for challenge, deliberation, and amendment without centralization or coercion.

## ✦ Section 3. Stewardship of Function and Purpose

**Consortia shall maintain a clear and living mandate that defines their purpose, scope, and obligations.** 

Stewards may be appointed to guide operations, mediate conflict, and ensure compliance with the Covenant. Such roles shall be bounded by term limits and collective review, and shall never serve as a path to personal dominance or organizational capture.

## ✦ Section 4. Relational Accountability

**Governance shall remain in lawful relation to the persons, places, and communities affected by the Consortium’s actions.** 

Advisory circles, community forums, and cyclical public audits shall ensure that the enterprise evolves in reciprocity and humility. No Consortium shall be deemed legitimate where it governs without listening, expands without consent, or persists without reflection.

---

*Let power be held in trust, not seized. Let governance be an act of service. Let ownership be a practice of stewardship, not dominion.*

# Article 5 - Resource Use, Access, and the Prohibition of Extraction

_Of the Lawful Boundaries and Ethical Obligations That Govern Material and Energetic Exchange_

---
## ✦ Section 1. Lawful Use of Resources

**Consortia shall make use of material, biological, informational, and energetic resources only in ways that uphold the regenerative, collective, and interdependent ethos of this Covenant.** 

Use shall be bound by need, sufficiency, care, and restoration—not excess, hoarding, or dominance. Every extraction shall be met with reciprocal investment, ecological respect, and social accountability.

## ✦ Section 2. Right of Access and Equitable Distribution

**Access to shared resources shall be determined by principles of equity, need, and reciprocal contribution—not privilege, purchase, or proximity.** 

Consortia shall design systems of provisioning, distribution, and sharing that prioritize dignity, sustainability, and community continuity. No person or community shall be systematically deprived due to status, lineage, or power.

## ✦ Section 3. Prohibition of Extraction

**No Consortium shall engage in extractive practices that exploit, degrade, or permanently deplete living systems, persons, or communities.** 

This includes but is not limited to environmental degradation, exploitative labor, speculative monopolization, enclosure of the Commons, and asymmetrical trade without restorative balance. Extraction without consent, regeneration, and lawful reciprocity shall be prohibited.

## ✦ Section 4. Regenerative Obligation and Cyclical Return

**Every Consortium shall be bound by a cyclical ethic: what is taken shall be returned, what is disrupted shall be restored, and what is consumed shall be replenished in kind or in kindred.** 

Practices of reinvestment, restoration, and reparative surplus shall be embedded into every process of use. Where harm occurs, remediation shall be both material and relational.

## ✦ Section 5. Review and Accountability of Resource Practices

**All resource practices of Consortia shall be subject to public review, ecological audit, and challenge by affected parties.** 

Cyclical reporting, transparent sourcing, and open channels for feedback shall be required. Where unjust or unlawful use is found, corrective and restorative action shall follow, guided by the principles of this Covenant.

---

_Let no Consortium take without return, use without humility, or build without balance. Let resource use be governed by law, love, and the rhythm of renewal._

# Article 6 - Accountability, Public Challenge, and Redress

_Of the Lawful Mechanisms That Sustain Justice Within and Around Consortia_

---

## ✦ Section 1. Principle of Continuous Accountability

**All Consortia shall remain in continuous accountability to their members, affected communities, and the Commons.** 

Accountability shall not be treated as a periodic task or administrative burden, but as a living relationship—structured through transparency, humility, and public responsiveness. This duty shall apply to every aspect of enterprise activity, including governance, finance, decision-making, labor relations, and ecological impact.

## ✦ Section 2. Right of Public Challenge

**Any person, member, or community directly or indirectly affected by a Consortium shall retain the standing to issue lawful challenge.** 

Such challenge may arise in cases of breach, harm, exclusion, neglect, coercion, or violation of the Covenant. Channels for challenge shall be publicly known, readily accessible, and protected from retaliation. Silence shall not be treated as consent, nor delay as denial.

## ✦ Section 3. Process of Review and Correction

**Upon public challenge, the Consortium in question shall initiate a transparent process of collective review, facilitated by an independent or community-guided body wherever possible.** 

This review shall include full disclosure of relevant records, the presence and testimony of affected parties, and the right to propose remedies, changes, or structural reconstitution. Review shall prioritize restoration over punishment, but may result in lawful dissolution if fidelity to the Covenant cannot be restored.

## ✦ Section 4. Reparative and Restorative Redress

**Where harm is found, redress shall be timely, proportional, and rooted in care.** 

Redress may include material compensation, redistribution of power, public acknowledgment of breach, structural transformation, or ceremonial acts of repair. The process shall be guided by those most impacted, and shall restore not only balance, but relation.

## ✦ Section 5. Safeguards Against Retaliation and Suppression

**No Consortium shall retaliate against those who voice dissent, raise grievance, or challenge breaches of law and care.** 

Any attempt to suppress challenge, conceal wrongdoing, or isolate complainants shall itself constitute a breach of this Covenant. Cultures of silence, fear, or impunity shall carry no lawful protection.

---

_Let every act of challenge be met with courage. Let every breach be faced with honesty. Let accountability become not a threat—but the bond that binds us back to justice._

# Article 7 - Cultural, Ecological, and Social Responsibility

_Of the Broader Commitments That Ground Every Consortium in Right Relation to the World_

---
## ✦ Section 1. Cultural Integrity and Respect

**Every Consortium shall operate with respect for the cultural memory, traditions, expressions, and knowledges of the communities it serves and affects.** 

Cultural appropriation, erasure, and the commodification of identity or ritual shall be prohibited. All engagements with cultural materials, practices, or partnerships shall be founded in consent, reciprocity, and transparency, and shall honor the origin and dignity of those from whom they arise.

## ✦ Section 2. Ecological Alignment and Bioregional Attunement

**Consortia shall orient their operations to the ecological realities, limits, and rhythms of the bioregions in which they are embedded.** 

This includes respecting watershed boundaries, ecological thresholds, seasonal cycles, and Indigenous territorial relations. Where global scope is necessary, all activities shall remain rooted in principles of ecological restraint, regenerative practice, and planetary balance.

## ✦ Section 3. Social Contribution and Solidarity

**All Consortia shall hold a positive duty to contribute to the flourishing of their communities and the broader social fabric.** 

This includes uplifting historically marginalized populations, redistributing surplus to where it is needed most, and engaging in acts of mutual aid. A Consortium’s success shall not be measured solely in efficiency or scale, but in the depth and durability of the relations it nourishes.

## ✦ Section 4. Educational and Intergenerational Role

**Consortia shall act not only as economic actors, but as vessels of education, mentorship, and intergenerational transmission.** 

Youth shall be welcomed into roles of co-stewardship; elders shall be honored as keepers of memory and method. Public learning, cultural literacy, and transmission of ecological and communal knowledge shall be supported as part of lawful enterprise.

## ✦ Section 5. Harm Prevention and Responsive Transformation

**Each Consortium shall remain vigilant against systemic harms—such as exclusion, burnout, extraction, or displacement—that may arise from even well-intended operations.** 

Harm prevention shall be embedded into design, planning, and evaluation. When harm does occur, transformation shall follow—not denial. The work of regeneration shall extend beyond the environment into the social, cultural, and psychic terrains.

---

_Let every Consortium become not only a center of activity, but a steward of meaning. Let its labor renew the land, its presence heal the past, and its future welcome all who seek dignity and belonging._

# Article 8 - Transition, Adaptation, and Living Evolution of Enterprise

_Of the Pathways Through Which Consortia Change, Respond, and Regenerate Over Time_

---

## ✦ Section 1. Enterprise as Living Form

**A Consortium shall be understood as a living entity, capable of change, learning, and renewal.** 

No Consortium shall be fixed in form or practice beyond the needs of its moment. Lawful enterprise shall evolve in relation to the communities it serves, the bioregions it inhabits, and the truths that emerge through time.

## ✦ Section 2. Pathways of Transition and Re-alignment

**All Consortia shall maintain clear and accessible mechanisms for transitioning leadership, restructuring governance, or shifting purpose in response to public will, ecological change, or emergent justice.** 

These mechanisms shall prioritize continuity of care, protection of workers and stakeholders, and re-alignment with the Covenant whenever breach or drift occurs.

## ✦ Section 3. Adaptive Governance and Seasonal Review

**Governance structures within Consortia shall be adaptive and subject to periodic review, revision, and public iteration.** 

No structure shall be presumed final. Cyclical reflection—whether seasonal, generational, or ritual—shall be practiced to assess alignment with values, goals, and community needs. What is not working shall be revised. What has expired shall be composted.

## ✦ Section 4. Mergers, Splits, and Legacy Transformation

**In the event of convergence or divergence—whether through merger, fork, dissolution, or legacy adaptation—Consortia shall retain the duty to preserve lawful continuity, shared memory, and stewardship of common assets.** 

No transition shall be used as cover for harm, erasure, or abandonment of responsibility. All structural evolution shall be guided by fidelity to this Covenant.

## ✦ Section 5. Evolution Through Relation

**Consortia evolve not alone, but in relation to other enterprises, assemblies, and communities within the Commons.** 

Cross-consortium learning, shared protocols, mutual mentorship, and federated experimentation shall be encouraged. Innovation is lawful where it emerges from care and returns to service.

---

_Let no enterprise stand still. Let change be a virtue. Let every Consortium evolve like a forest—diverse, resilient, and rooted in renewal._

# Article 9 – Economic Transition and Transformation

_Of the Pathways From Extractive Capitalism to Regenerative Commonwealth_

---

## ✦ Section 1. Recognition of Transition Necessity

**The transformation from extractive to regenerative economics shall be recognized as both urgent necessity and generational undertaking.**

Current systems of corporate capitalism violate the Core and Commons through their structural requirements for endless growth, wealth concentration, and ecological destruction. Yet billions depend on these systems for their daily survival. The transition must therefore be swift enough to prevent collapse, gradual enough to prevent chaos, and thorough enough to prevent reversion.

## ✦ Section 2. Conversion Pathways for Existing Corporations

**All existing corporations shall be provided clear pathways to transform into Consortia or other Covenant-aligned forms.**

Primary conversion pathways shall include worker ownership transitions through phased buyouts and cooperative conversion, community ownership through land trusts and public acquisition, multi-stakeholder transformation including workers, communities, and service users, and dissolution with asset redistribution for irredeemably extractive entities. Conversion support shall include financing, legal assistance, and transition planning.

## ✦ Section 3. Sunset Provisions for Corporate Charters

**All corporate charters shall expire within ten years of Covenant enactment unless renewed under Consortium principles.**

Renewal requirements shall escalate over time, beginning with transparency and stakeholder participation, advancing to profit-sharing and ecological accountability, and culminating in full alignment with regenerative commerce. Corporations failing to meet renewal standards shall face graduated restrictions on operations, mandatory transition planning, and eventual dissolution with worker and community protection.

## ✦ Section 4. Transition Support Systems

**Comprehensive support shall be provided to workers, communities, and small enterprises during economic transition.**

Such support shall encompass universal basic services ensuring no one lacks necessities during transition, retraining programs for workers leaving extractive industries, debt forgiveness for individuals and communities harmed by predatory finance, conversion financing for businesses transforming to Covenant alignment, and community resilience funds for localities heavily dependent on extractive industry.

## ✦ Section 5. Alternative Economy Building

**Communities shall be empowered to build Covenant-aligned economies in parallel with transformation of existing systems.**

This includes support for new Consortia and cooperative enterprises, community land trusts and commons management, local and bioregional currencies, mutual aid networks and gift economies, and skill-sharing and community production systems. The new economy shall grow within the shell of the old until it can fully emerge.

## ✦ Section 6. Wealth Transformation and Limits

**Extreme wealth concentration shall be recognized as incompatible with dignity and democracy.**

Transition measures shall include progressive wealth taxation escalating with concentration, wealth caps preventing unlimited accumulation, reparative redistribution to communities harmed by extraction, and conversion of private wealth to commons endowments. Those who have extracted shall contribute to restoration.

## ✦ Section 7. International Coordination

**Economic transition shall be coordinated across bioregions and continents to prevent capital flight and ensure justice.**

Coordination mechanisms shall include synchronized timelines for corporate transformation, trade preferences for Covenant-aligned entities, technology and resource sharing between regions, support for Global South transitions, and collective response to capital flight or sabotage. No region shall bear transition costs alone.

## ✦ Section 8. Protection Against Sabotage

**Communities shall be protected from economic warfare by those resisting transition.**

Protective measures shall include restrictions on capital mobility during transition phases, community right of first refusal on major asset sales, prohibition of transition-evading corporate restructuring, criminal accountability for deliberate economic harm, and rapid response networks for community defense. Resistance to transformation shall not be permitted to cause suffering.

## ✦ Section 9. Small Enterprise Facilitation

**Small businesses already operating in community alignment shall be provided simplified pathways to Consortium recognition.**

Recognizing that many small enterprises already embody Covenant principles, transition support shall include streamlined certification for aligned businesses, protection from corporate predation, access to Consortium networks and resources, and exemption from requirements designed for large corporations. The creativity of small enterprise shall be honored and preserved.

## ✦ Section 10. Irreversible Momentum

**Each phase of transition shall create structural changes making reversion to extraction impossible.**

This includes conversion of corporate property to commons management, establishment of worker and community ownership that cannot be resold, embedding of ecological limits in all economic planning, creation of new measures of success beyond profit, and cultivation of cultural transformation alongside structural change. The old world shall not be permitted to reassert itself.

## ✦ Section 11. Transition Justice

**Those harmed by extractive economics shall be prioritized in the distribution of transition benefits.**

Communities devastated by extraction shall receive restoration resources first. Workers whose labor was exploited shall gain ownership stakes. Indigenous peoples whose lands were stolen shall see return and reparation. The transition shall be guided by justice, not merely efficiency.

## ✦ Section 12. Joy in Transformation

**Economic transition shall be understood not as loss but as liberation.**

The movement from extraction to regeneration offers release from meaningless labor, healing of community divisions, restoration of damaged landscapes, rediscovery of mutual aid, and renewal of creative purpose. Communities shall celebrate each milestone of transformation as steps toward collective flourishing.

---

_Let the old economy of taking become a new economy of tending. Let those who hoarded discover the joy of sharing. Let those who extracted learn to regenerate. Let the transition be both pragmatic and profound, for we are not merely changing rules but healing relationships—with each other, with Earth, and with the future._
