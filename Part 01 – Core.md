*Of the Sovereign Rights, Duties, and Protections That Govern All Persons, Peoples, and Communities Under this Covenant*

# Article 1 – Sovereignty & Supremacy

_Of the Inherent Authority of the People and the Binding Force of this Covenant_

## ✦ Section 1. Source of Authority

**Sovereignty shall reside in the People of Earth.**

All lawful power arises from the inherent dignity of persons, the self-determining will of communities, and the collective capacity of peoples to govern themselves in peace, care, and relation. No law, decree, institution, state, or platform shall supersede this authority, nor claim lawful dominion over the People.

All systems shall remain accountable to the People from whom their authority arises.

This Covenant affirms that no hierarchy of birth, belief, wealth, or conquest shall hold lawful power above the will of the People.

## ✦ Section 2. Supremacy

**This Covenant shall be the supreme law of Earth.**

All systems of governance, commerce, jurisprudence, and custom—past, present, or future—shall be subject to its principles. Where contradiction arises, this Covenant shall prevail. Its supremacy shall carry binding force not through coercion, but through rightful relation and participatory consent.

No law shall hold standing where it violates dignity, consent, or the regenerative balance of Earth.

## ✦ Section 3. Jurisdiction and Reach

**The authority of this Covenant shall apply across all systems, environments, and relations on Earth.**

Its provisions shall govern land, sea, air, digital space, institutions, economies, and communities. No structure shall lie beyond its reach.

This Covenant does not require permission to take effect. It takes effect because it is just.

# Article 2 – Rights of Persons and Peoples

_The Inviolable Liberties of All Persons and Their Rightful Communities_

## ✦ Section 1. Right to Dignity

**The right of every person to dignity shall not be infringed.**

No person shall be subjected to treatment, structure, or condition that denies their inherent worth, sovereignty, or belonging. This right shall hold standing above all law, decree, or system. No person, entity, or collective—whether public or private—shall violate this right without committing a breach of the law.

Dignity is not granted. It is recognized in law because it precedes law.

## ✦ Section 2. Right to Thought, Conscience, and Expression

**The right of the people to think, believe, express, and assemble shall not be infringed.**

This right includes spiritual, political, cultural, and artistic expression. The freedom to dissent, critique, declare, or celebrate in accordance with one’s conscience, memory, or lifeway shall be protected across all media and forms. No person shall be punished or diminished for their beliefs, practices, or peaceful acts of voice.

## ✦ Section 3. Right to Legal Standing and Equal Protection

**The right of every person to be named, heard, and protected under the law shall not be denied.**

This includes the right to challenge injustice, seek remedy, and receive equal treatment without prejudice. No person shall be cast outside the protections of this Covenant due to identity, lineage, origin, disability, class, status, or condition. The law shall protect without exception and apply without exclusion.

## ✦ Section 4. Right to Safety, Shelter, and Care

**The right of the people to live free from harm, deprivation, abandonment, or artificial scarcity shall not be infringed.**

Access to food, water, shelter, healing, and education shall be upheld as conditions of freedom—not as privileges of wealth. No person shall be punished through neglect or cast into harm by omission.

## ✦ Section 5. Right to Privacy and Autonomy

**The right of the people to privacy, bodily autonomy, and freedom from surveillance shall not be infringed.**

No person shall be monitored, tracked, mined, harvested, or subjected to surveillance. Consent obtained through dependency, necessity, or structural coercion shall be void. The withholding of basic needs, services, or participation to compel agreement shall constitute a breach of this Covenant. The right to withdraw, to remain unseen, and to act without manipulation shall carry full legal force.

## ✦ Section 6. Right to Refuse and Resist

**The right of the people to refuse structures of domination and to resist systems that violate this Covenant shall not be infringed.**

No law, order, government, or doctrine shall prohibit the peaceful defense of life, dignity, or relation. Resistance in the name of justice shall be a lawful act.


# Article 3 – Rights of Earth & Future Generations

_The Standing of the Living World and the Inheritance of All Who Are Yet to Come_

## ✦ Section 1. Standing of Earth

**The Earth and all its living systems shall hold legal standing under this Covenant.**

The forests, rivers, oceans, mountains, animals, soils, fungi, skies, and all interdependent ecologies of the planet shall be protected as subjects of law—not as property, resource, or means to accumulation. The Earth shall not be owned, traded, desecrated, or sacrificed for profit. The right of Earth to regenerate, evolve, and thrive shall be held inviolate.

## ✦ Section 2. Protection from Harm

**No system shall hold standing where it causes permanent ecological harm, extinction, or collapse.**

This includes systems that degrade bioregions, destroy species, pollute watersheds, fracture climate stability, or break the cyclical reciprocity of life. Every law, practice, and institution upheld under this Covenant shall support regeneration and renewal. Where ecocide is present, active, or imminent, prevention, challenge, and remediation shall follow.

## ✦ Section 3. Rights of Future Generations

**The right of future generations of the people to inherit a living world shall not be infringed.**

This right includes access to clean air, potable water, fertile soil, biological and linguistic diversity, cultural memory, healthy ecosystems, and the tools to govern with wisdom and care. It includes the right to prosperity and the freedom to shape a future not predetermined by domination.

Silence from the future shall not be mistaken for permission. Their rights speak through our responsibilities.

# Article 4 – Duties and Responsibilities of the People

_Of the Living Commitments That Uphold this Covenant and Sustain the World_

## ✦ Section 1. Duty to Uphold Dignity and Justice

**The duty of the people to uphold the dignity of every person and act in accordance with justice shall be binding.**

This Covenant shall live not only in law, but in the daily conduct of those governed by it.

## ✦ Section 2. Duty of Remembrance

**The duty of the people to remember shall be binding.**

# Article 5 – Protections Against Harm

_Of the Prohibitions That Guard Dignity, Stewardship, and Peace_

## ✦ Section 1. Prohibition of Domination and Discrimination

Monitoring, targeting, data harvesting, or behavior modification without meaningful and freely given consent shall be prohibited. The right to withdraw from observation, to remain untracked, and to be free from coercive design shall be protected in all environments—physical or digital.

Privacy is not a privilege. It is the boundary of freedom.

## ✦ Section 4. Prohibition of Torture, Disappearance, and Depersonalization

**No person shall be subjected to torture, degrading treatment, disappearance, or permanent dislocation from community or land.**

All forms of cruelty, psychological manipulation, indefinite confinement, isolation, and ritual humiliation are hereby prohibited. No state, faction, or institution may justify such acts in war, peace, law, religion, emergency, or exception.

Dignity shall not be suspended. No cause shall be allowed to erase the person.

_Of the Standing of Communities as Lawful Actors in Governance, Culture, and Relation_

## ✦ Section 1. Right to Existence and Self-Definition

**The right of communities to exist, self-organize, and define their cultural, spiritual, and social lifeways shall not be infringed.**

A community shall be any collective of persons joined by shared relation, care, locality, intention, or lineage.

## ✦ Section 2. Right to Participation in Governance

**The right of communities to participate directly in governance, through self-declaration, convocation, and collective enactment, shall not be infringed.**

## ✦ Section 3. Right to Protection and Non-Dissolution

**Communities shall be protected from forced dissolution, fragmentation, cultural erasure, or external domination.**

No system, market, regime, or institution shall lawfully dispossess a community of its language, land, ritual, knowledge, or cohesion. The integrity of communities shall be guarded as a matter of law and of planetary continuity.

_Of the Shared Obligations That Arise Through Collective Life and Lawful Relation_

## ✦ Section 1. Duty to Uphold this Covenant

This includes ensuring that collective governance remains participatory, transparent, and free from coercion; that no system of dominance is sustained in their name; and that all persons within and beyond the community are treated with dignity.

No community shall perpetuate structures of oppression, silence, or extraction under the protection of autonomy.

## ✦ Section 2. Duty of Mutual Aid and Solidarity

This includes the responsibility to conserve, restore, and regenerate bioregions, to prevent ecological harm, and to organize life systems in alignment with the rhythms of place. Ecocide shall not be protected by community sovereignty

## ✦ Section 4. Duty of Public Challenge and Reconstitution

Communities shall hold the duty to challenge breaches of this Covenant and reconstitute relation where harm has occurred.

This includes the responsibility to examine internal practices, respond to grievance, and remain open to change, recall, or renewal. The right to withdraw from unjust systems shall be paired with the duty to build just ones in their place.

## ✦ Section 1. Right to Revoke Consent

**The right of the people to withdraw consent from any government, institution, or system that violates this Covenant shall not be infringed.**

## ✦ Section 2. Conditions of Breach

**A breach shall be held to occur when a governing body, economic system, technological platform, or community structure:**

- Violates the rights of persons, peoples, or Earth,
- Breaks its duties under this Covenant,

- Or perpetuates domination through concealment, coercion, or systemic exclusion.

A breach may be declared through public challenge, ceremonial withdrawal, or collective declaration.

## ✦ Section 3. Power of Reconstitution

**Where a breach has occurred, the people shall hold the right to reconstitute governance by lawful means.**

This includes the formation of new assemblies, the drafting of new declarations, and the creation of alternative systems in full alignment with this Covenant. Communities may initiate reconstitution locally, regionally, or globally, provided it arises from transparent process and participatory relation.

Reconstitution is not rebellion. It is the lawful act of renewal.

## ✦ Section 4. Continuity and Care

**In the process of reconstitution, the people shall hold the duty to maintain continuity of care, public memory, and protection of the vulnerable.**

No reformation shall be carried out by domination, neglect, or vengeance. The new shall not repeat the harm of the old. All reconstitution shall be guided by the Core.

The future shall be remembered forward.
