We, the People of Earth, in sovereign assembly and with full awareness of our duty to life, to liberty, and to the Earth itself — in order to secure the dignity of all persons, to protect the Commons as the domain of life, to uphold justice and repair harm, to ensure continuity across generations, and to govern in peace, consent, and shared stewardship — do ordain and establish this Covenant for the Commons of Earth.
